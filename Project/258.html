            Triptych is a format of artistic production that originated in religious paintings in art history. It has three parts, and while each part may stand on its own and present, the final composition is designed to be understood and engaged as all three pieces being placed in their proper position. Having inspiration from the two-dimensional design that expresses the double exposure effect of identical shapes, I set the rules for myself of using identical but shifted shapes to create voids that connect each part of the triptych. This creates a language like musical notations that jumps and plays the tone between the three parts.
