        <h1>Ming Chen</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Ming Chen, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Architecture at the University of Michigan's Taubman College, with a minor in User Experience Design. My journey in architecture has been a blend of creativity, collaboration, and technical skill development, supported by a strong academic foundation (GPA: 3.97). I've had the opportunity to intern at Zhejiang Lvcheng Liuhe Architectural Design Co., where I contributed to innovative projects like designing an auditorium and competing in an AI-driven school design competition, earning our team a prestigious award. At school, I enjoy diving into hands-on projects, such as casting structures and exploring photogrammetry in research. Beyond academics, I'm deeply passionate about community engagement, whether teaching art history during rural revitalization initiatives or connecting with peers through organizations like Alpha Rho Chi and the Michigan Rifle Team. With a love for creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration, I am excited to continue shaping spaces that inspire and connect people.
